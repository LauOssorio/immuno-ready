# Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
This tool is being developed primarily for educational purposes‚Äîto explore how to build tools like this and to create a pharma-oriented coding portfolio. While we strive for scientific accuracy, any conclusions drawn from its results should not be considered definitive or used as the sole basis for decision-making.

That said, if you run or collaborate with a wet lab specializing in immuno-oncology and are interested in validating this tool through experiments, we‚Äôd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out‚Äîwe're always open to meaningful collaborations.
